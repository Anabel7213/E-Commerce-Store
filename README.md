## E-Commerce Platform

### Tools:
The store is built with Next.js, Tailwind, and React making use of the pre-built shadcnUI components. It's connected to the E-Commerce Admin Dashboard, a project I built earlier, which allows us to add and manage products, customer inquiries, and a ton more. The store and the dashboard effectively exchange all data between each other through Prisma and PlanetScale.

### Key Features:
1. Search & Category Sorting: quickly search for a products or sort by category from the homepage.
2. Product Page: browse product details, and get similar product suggestions.
3. Reviews: leave a public review, and potentially get a response from the store (done through the dashboard accessible to a store admin).
4. Shopping Cart: add and remove products from the cart, see your total, check out using Stripe Payment System.
5. Inquiries: inquire about a topic as a customer (the inquiry will appear on the admin's dashboard where the admin can update its status and respond).
6. Newsletter: subscribe to a newsletter.
